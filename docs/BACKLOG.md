# Backlog

Prioritized work items for Pixery. Tags: `#bug`, `#tech-debt`, `#feature`, `#ux`

**How to use this document:**
- Items live in priority sections (Blocking → In Progress → Next Up → Later → Someday)
- When completed, remove from original section and add to Completed under the version shipped
- Keep descriptions concise

## Blocking

Critical issues that must be fixed before next release.

*None currently.*

## In Progress

Items currently being worked on.

## Next Up

High priority items to tackle next.

- [ ] `#bug` Compare view does not close on Esc - wire Esc key to exit compare view back to gallery

- [ ] `#ux` Generate modal references panel too tall - fixed 320px height pushes editor into scroll; reduce to ~120px or make collapsible so prompt/model/tags area has room

- [ ] `#ux` Negative prompt only for models that use it - detect from ModelInfo or PromptingGuide whether a model supports negative prompts (selfhosted SDXL models do, Gemini/OpenAI/fal don't); only show Advanced section when relevant model is selected

- [ ] `#ux` Prompt autocomplete improvements - show generation title alongside prompt for recognition (prompts are often too long); respect hidden tags (never suggest prompts from generations tagged with actively-hidden tags)

- [ ] `#ux` Context menu: remove from collection - when right-clicking an image while viewing a collection, show "Remove from collection" option

- [ ] `#ux` Hidden collections in settings - add ability to hide collections from sidebar (similar to hidden tags)

- [ ] `#feature` Safe mode toggle - single toggle in settings that hides all registered sensitive collections and tags at once; quick way to make the gallery presentable

- [ ] `#ux` Details close button - make X button larger, follow best practices for dismiss targets

- [ ] `#ux` Shared close button component - create reusable X button for all closeable elements (cost dashboard, popups, detail column)


- [ ] `#ux` Cost dashboard icon - replace text link with coin icon and smaller text, consistent with other header actions

- [ ] `#ux` Move filtering/search to header bar - relocate all filter controls from sidebar to header; keep sidebar free for future functionality

- [ ] `#feature` Model duration estimation for progress indicators - analyze generations per model to estimate response times; use estimates for model-specific progress bars in header showing in-progress generations; after first N generations for a model with insufficient data, store duration estimate in DB

- [ ] `#ux` Toggleable details panel size - allow small/medium/large panel widths

## Later

Items to address when bandwidth allows.

- [ ] `#feature` IP-Adapter for self-hosted Animagine - character consistency via reference images; weights downloaded, needs ~3.7GB CLIP image encoder + server.py integration

- [ ] `#feature` Regenerate with parent_id - track lineage when regenerating (DB schema ready, not wired up)

- [ ] `#feature` Notifications - alert when background generation completes (plugin configured, not implemented)

- [ ] `#feature` Enhanced cost dashboard - make interactive with filtering by date range, models, and tags; drill-down views for cost analysis

## Someday

Ideas and features for future consideration.

- [ ] `#feature` Image editing/inpainting support
- [ ] `#feature` Cost tracking and reporting
- [ ] `#feature` Tag management UI in sidebar
- [ ] `#feature` Export/import database for backup
- [ ] `#feature` Model info page - dedicated view explaining each model's strengths, weaknesses, costs, output sizes, and optimal use cases
- [ ] `#feature` Semantic tagging/RAG system - auto-generate tags from prompts, titles, and existing tags using embedding-based search; future exploration
