Providers
==========

API integration layer for external image generation services. Each provider has distinct quirks that aren't evident from code alone.

Gemini
----------

**DO NOT** assume model IDs are stable — Gemini renames models frequently. When calls start failing, check the Python backup at `~/tools/imagen-python-backup/` for last-known-working IDs. The `_ => model` fallback silently passes broken IDs through, so failures surface as API errors, not Rust errors.

**DO NOT** wrap base64 in data URIs — Gemini expects bare base64 strings with MIME type passed separately.

Seeds are not returned by the Gemini API (always NULL in database).

fal.ai
----------

**DO NOT** ignore 202 or 400 responses during polling — both can mean "still processing":
- 202 = queued, keep polling
- 400 with "still in progress" message = also keep polling (not an error)

The current 2-minute timeout (`MAX_POLL_ATTEMPTS * 500ms`) works for most models but slower ones may need adjustment.

**DO NOT** pass multiple references to Z-Image Turbo — max 1 reference for image-to-image. Code uses `.first()` but doesn't validate; extra refs are silently dropped.

**Z-Image endpoint routing**: `resolve_model()` routes to different API endpoints based on `has_reference`:
- `false` → `fal-ai/z-image/turbo` (text-to-image)
- `true` → `fal-ai/z-image/turbo/image-to-image`

This polymorphism is intentional but non-obvious. The `strength` parameter only applies to image-to-image; it's silently ignored for text-to-image.

**DO** wrap base64 as data URIs — fal.ai expects `data:{mime};base64,{encoded}` format, unlike Gemini/OpenAI.

OpenAI
----------

**DO NOT** expect reference support — DALL-E 3 and gpt-image-1 ignore the `reference_paths` parameter entirely. No warning is logged; references are silently dropped. The parameter exists for interface consistency across providers.

**DO NOT** wrap base64 in data URIs — OpenAI expects bare base64 strings, like Gemini.

Seeds are not returned by the OpenAI API (always NULL in database).

Cross-Provider
----------

**Base64 format inconsistency** is intentional per each API's contract:
- fal.ai: `data:{mime};base64,{encoded}`
- Gemini: bare base64 + separate MIME type
- OpenAI: bare base64

A new provider must check which format that API expects.

**Seed availability varies**: fal.ai returns seeds, Gemini and OpenAI don't. Frontend can't assume seed will be populated.

**Image format detection** in `archive.rs` defaults to PNG when format is undetectable. If a provider returns an unusual format (WEBP, AVIF), verify the MIME type matches what gets saved.
